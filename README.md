PFAnnounce
==========

I was majorly dissatisfied with the current selection of header announcement plugins. So here you go, quick plugin to show announcements on the index and portal pages. 

Installation
----------
Drop inc/plugins/pfannounce.php into the /site_root/inc/plugins/ directory and activate in ACP. 

TODO
------
(for the generous people)

- Use templates. Get rid of this repulsive hard coded HTML.
- Add option to use on all pages. OR Add option to select which pages for it to be shown. <-- Preferably the latter.
